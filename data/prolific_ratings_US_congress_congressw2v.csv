Congress passed a threeyear bill authorizing HAB and hypoxia research programs. with a focus on the ""dead zone"" in the Gulf of Mexico and Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay. The Act was reauthorized in 2004. and added freshwater. such as the Great Lakes. as an important area for HAB and hypoxia research. It also increased the participation of local resource managers in developing HAB and hypoxia research plans. ensuring that the research was prioritized to address the questions facing people working with HABs and hypoxia on a daily basis. Also. the bill required that all research funding be administered through a competitive. meritbased. peerreviewed process. The amendments we are considering today strengthen the algal bloom research activities at NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). and improve the communication and coordination between the many federal. state and local stakeholders.

After a week of debate and amendments as well as the negotiations that preceded floor action. the DoleJohnston substitute has been modified in a nunriber of ways. There are. however. major issues that still distinguish the two bills and recommend support for the GlennChafee substitute. In my mind. there are five major areas of difference remaining.

These analyses should inform agency decisionmaking -inform agency decisionmaking. They should not unilaterally control those decisions and impose leastcost solutions to every problem.

I have introduced legislation to separate the airmail subsidy so that payments to airlines for transporting mail will not be charged to the postal deficit. This seems to me to be a constructive step. It was first suggested by the Hoover Commission. and I am happy to note a parallel bill is making progress in the other body. This subsidy amounts to between thirty to sixty million dollars. The Post Office and Civil Service Conmittee is to be commended for reporting a mailrateincrease bill. This appears to be a necessary step toward solution of the postal deficit problem. However. I rise in support of the Lyle amendment. It calls for a 30percent increase in secondclass rates on publications. instead of the 60percent increase provided in the committee bill.

One of the first acts of Mr. Jeffersons administration was to wipe them from the statute book. The present system was adopted during the late lamentable war between the States. We do not now require its continuance. Tariff duties. if properly laid. will yield us an abundant revenue. These internal taxes bear much more oppressively upon the people than do import duties. I would take off the tax not only on matches. and the tax on bankchecks. and all else that is embraced in this bill. but I would if I could. as I have stated. repeal the whole system. I would abolish entirely the onerous and unjust tax on tobacco. on whisky. and on distilled and refined spirits. These are taxes which come upon the laboring masses.

As of June 30. last year. the Service reported soil conservation districts had a total of approximately 1.860.000 cooperators. operating nearly 564 million acres. More than 11/4 million of those soil conservation district cooperators had basic conservation plans. on more than 365 million acres in about 2.860 soil conservation districts. There are similar figures showing notable progress with the land capability surveys and with the individual conservation measures that have been applied on the farms and watersheds of America. They only serve to confirm further the gains we have made. But we are still in the beginning stage. The conservation job is far from being completed. Some 2 million farms still need basic conservation plans. Thousands of tributary watersheds need the combined conservation land treatment and structural work contemplated in the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act.

The report revealed that TSA lacks strict policies and procedures for maintaining critical screening technology, including x-ray machines and explosive detection equipment. The consequences of this deficiency could be severe. First, as the inspector general's report noted, the lack of regular maintenance reduces the life of screening equipment, which means TSA would have to incur the cost of new equipment.

We cannot risk the guidance being overturned by future administrations. So, in conversations with DOD, I asked if they had any objections to the Colorado language that is laid out in the AP/1 handbook being codified. Subsequently, in direct correspondence with my office on both May 13 and June 4 of this year, DOD both times stated no objection to the codification. The only way to be able to provide certainty for HAATS is to ensure the implementation of the Colorado guidance by codifying that in this bill. So, what is that guidance? Current law requires DOD aircraft to be able to fly at a minimum of 2,000 feet above designated wilderness areas.

The strength of the MCA. or Millennium Challenge Account. is that it focuses responsibility for economic growth on the policies of the governments of developing countries. One important lesson the United States has learned from our experience is financial assistance can only be effective when developing countries are committed to establishing the necessary economic. legal. and political reforms.

Such few disputes as may result in a truly national emergency of a character actually imperiling the public safety can be met successfully through measures for bringing all the tremendous forces of public opinion effectively to bear in support of the President and in such a manner as to induce settlement by the parties themselves.

Ukrainian leaders issued a proclamation of the restoration of Ukrainian independence. and a provisional government was appointed. Mr. Yaroslav Stetsk. a prominent leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists. became Prime Minister.

Instead their organization decentralized and melted away in the deep underground where they continued the Ukrainian national liberation struggle by means appropriate to changed conditions. The Soviet Russians are also aware of these facts and this explains why the events of June 30. 1941. are of extreme significance. The importance of this event cannot be downplayed.

What we are saying In the amendment. very simply. is that when land use goes beyond water pollution and water supply questions. health questions. and safety questions. to questions involving land use insofar as whether it is for agricultural or conservation purposes. or construction on the land. those questions of land use are matters which should be left for the State government and the local government to decide. In my Judgment these two amendments could be incorporated into this bill and not detract at all from the rest of the concerns of the bill. which are very valid concerns of the Federal Government.

The report released by the Joint Economic Committee on Monday of this week puts great emphasis on the need for an increase in productivity.

The Council of Economic Advisers in their 1978 report termed the productivity slowdown ""one of the most significant economic problems in recent years."" In my judgment a substantial contributing factor to the slowdown in productivity is the growing lack of capital investment in modernization of our industrial economy.

The astronomical salaries received each year by new and untested superstars simply remove from available resources large amounts which could otherwise be employed to the benefit of the vast majority of players. The players stand. directly and substantially. to benefit from the merger: First. The merger of the two independent leagues into a single expanded league will preserve the job opportunities offered by professional basketball. It will bring economic stability to teams now facing frequent franchise shifts and possible financial ruin. Every franchise failure means the loss of 12 player jobs. Second. The stability afforded by the merger will improve the earning opportunities of many clubs.
