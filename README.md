# Computational analysis of US congressional speeches reveals a shift from evidence to intuition

This repository contains the code for the analysis and results in the manuscript **Computational analysis of US congressional speeches reveals a shift from evidence to intuition**

## Notes
* The scripts are numbered in the order in which the results in the paper are presented with results saved in the `output` directory.
* The aggregated EMI score and data for variables required to make plots and run statistical analysis are in this repository under the `data` directory.
* For the code in the directory `compute_EMI` to execute, the required Congressional speeches and embedding model are in a separate [OSF repository](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/Z6UTW), because of their size.
